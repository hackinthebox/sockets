# Sockets Challenge

[Stage 1]
Create a server and client. The server will send a file in multiple payloads to the client on connection.

[Stage 2]
Use ncurses to make the client program interactive. 
Add a RPC function to the server, that will list the files in a files sub-directory. 
The client can select a file to download from this list.
